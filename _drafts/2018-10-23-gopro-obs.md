title: Using a Gopro as a Source in OBS

The GoPro is a terrific device for capturing video. It's small, has great picture quality, and supports many video transfer options. Currently, there are two ways to capture live video from a GoPro as a source in OBS: stream the video to a RTMP server or connect via a capture card. Neither method is exatly what I was looking for when I tried this setup but the processes are worth documenting, in case others are trying the same.

## Using a Capture Card

OBS treats a capture card as a "video capture source" and anything able to output video via HDMI can work with one: gaming consoles, digital cameras, video cams, and the GoPro. In fact, the steps to set up most devices with a capture card are almost the same.

### What You Need

* A capture card that accepts HDMI input. I used an Elgato HD60S.
* A GoPro with an HDMI out.
* A micro HDMI to HDMI cable.
* A USB-3 or USB-C cable. This will be used to power the GoPro.
* A computer with OBS installed.
* A GoPro mount (optional)

#### Connect your GoPro to power.

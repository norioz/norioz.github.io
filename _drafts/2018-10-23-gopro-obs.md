The GoPro is a terrific device for capturing video. It's small, has great picture quality, and is packed with features. Currently there are two ways to capture the video from a GoPro as a source in OBS: stream the video to a RTMP server or connect via a capture card. Both methods will be detailed in this post but using a capture card isn't unique to the GoPro, you could use the same steps to hook up any video capture device with an HDMI out port.
